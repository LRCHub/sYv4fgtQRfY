She drew a circle round the exit
A statement just to kill their doubt
And said "we're waiting on a chance that never comes
There's no other way than out"
And I won't mind
Should dreams just perish into dust
- You're by my side

Let's leave tonight
Heaven knows we need to put things right
These city lights
A tangerine line fading out of sight

The discontent and fear of failing
We always wore it on our sleeves
Let's part from this town and for once in our lives
Put our restless hearts to ease
I, I've been waiting long to tell you
Your sad half-smile is see-through
This waiting wears you down

Let's leave tonight
Heaven knows we need to put things right
These city lights
A tangerine line fading out of sight

And you, you said to me
"Someday we'll find that place to be"
So this time let's leave for sure
"But do we know what we're searching for?"
