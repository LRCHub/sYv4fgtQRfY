I know you, / you know me, /
We don't need anything at all, / anyway. /
The club lounge, / the right sounds, /
But we were heading for a fall, / just slipped away, /

So tell me, /
How did we get this far, / how did we get this far, /
How did we get this far, / anyway? /
So tell me, /
How did we get this far, / how did we get this far, /
How did we get this far, / far away? /

In deep space, / a big place /
Where we were hiding from it all, / yesterday. /
Up mountains, / a snow-ride, /
I don't feel anything at all, / anyway, /

And tell me, /
How did we get this far, / how did we get this far, /
How did we get this far, / anyway? /
And tell me, /
How did we get this far, / how did we get this far, /
How did we get this far, / far away? /

So far away, / so far away. /

And tell me, /
How did we get this far, / how did we get this far, /
How did we get this far, / anyway? /
And tell me, /
How did we get this far, / how did we get this far, /
How did we get this far, / far away? /

So tell me, /
How did we get this far, (how did we get this far?) /
How did we get this far, (how did we get this far?) /
How did we get this far, / anyway? /
And baby, /
How did we get this far, (how did we get this far?) /
How did we get this far, (how did we get this far?) /
How did we get this far, / far away? /

So far away, / far away. /
So far away, / far away. /
So far away, / far away. /
So far away, / far away.
