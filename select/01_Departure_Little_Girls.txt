You got your keys, but where ya goin'?
The third degree just isn't workin'
Cause you walked out without asking me to go
And if I followed you home, would you be alone?

I checked your phone, cause it was beepin'
Are you alone?
I know you're creepin'
Cause you walked out without asking me to go
But if I followed you home, I hope you're alone

I'm three steps from the edge, woah
Don't push me over it
Don't you know, don't you know

Every girl is capable of murder, if you hurt her
Watch out you don't push me any further, any further
You're not the only one walking 'round with a loaded gun
This little girl is capable of murder, cause you hurt her

My hands are clean, not yet a killer
Ain't I your queen?
And did you tell her?
Cause you broke down all my shoulda known betters
And then I followed you home, throwin' sticks and stones

I'm two steps form the edge woah
Don't push me over it
Don't you know, don't you know

Every girl is capable of murder, if you hurt her
Watch out you don't push me any further, any further
You're not the only one walking 'round with a loaded gun
This little girl is capable of murder, cause you hurt her

Don't you know you should never treat a girl like that?
Got a good alibi and my bag's all packed
Don't you know you should never treat a girl like that?
Cause the next one's gonna have a hammer pulled back

Every girl is capable of murder
So watch out you don't push me any further
(But you fucking hurt her)

Every girl is capable woah, if you hurt her
Watch out you don't push me any further
You're not the only one walkin' round with a loaded gun
This little girl is capable of murder (Hey!)
This little girl is capable of murder, cause you hurt her
